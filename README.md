# Mars Colony App

This project is to create a web-based application for Earth colonists exploring Mars using Angular 2. To elaborate further, we build an app with GET and POST HTTP request using Angular's HTTP service to achieve the following goals; 1.) Save a new Colonist's information. 2.) Save a new Alien encounter. 3.) Fetch a list of recent Alien encounter. 4.) Create a new Encounter report. 


# Technology used

-angular module (different component files)
-angular built in directives (ngFor, ngClass, ngIf, ngModel)
-angular 2 router (navigation from one page to another)
-Implement with function ngForm (to validate user input)
-POST & GET request (using REST API)
-Customize colonist ID and encounter ID tailored to the user input
-CSS (using box shadow to create a login object with different shadow effects)
-JSON, API & Endpoint
-Typescript files and typescript compilers

# Personal learning
First, I learnt how to use Postman apps to make web request to the server. It uses API to send JSON to make that request. Second, I have learnt how to create a service class for each API endpoint to send and receive the data that access the data to our application. Third, I have added routes to our application which enabled navigation to different pages on our web app. Finally, I have learnt how to code for HTML forms. Using nFor function to implement a select menu according to the user input. Using Two way binding to update the form value whenever the user input something different.
